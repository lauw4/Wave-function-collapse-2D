# Wave Collapse Map

This project is a 2D map generator in Python3 that utilizes the wave collapse algorithm. It creates a game environment with a player and characters. The player can be controlled using direction keys, while the characters move randomly. The objective is for the player to avoid getting caught by the characters, as being caught will result in the player being deleted from the map.

## Installation

To run the game, make sure you have Python3 installed on your system. You can install the required libraries by running:

## Usage

Run the game by executing the following command:
>> Python3 Controller.py

Once the game is running, you can control the player using the arrow keys. Avoid the characters moving randomly on the map. If the player gets caught by a character, the game ends.

## Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the player.
- Avoid getting caught by the characters moving randomly on the map.
- If the player gets caught by a character, the game ends.
- The objective is to survive as long as possible without getting caught.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Main Python script to run the game.
- `map.py`: Contains classes and functions for generating the game map.
- `character.py`: Contains classes for defining the player and characters.
- `requirements.txt`: Specifies the required libraries for the project.
